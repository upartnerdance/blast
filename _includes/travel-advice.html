    <h3>Parking</h3>
    <p>
      You can park anywhere on campus, though we recommend parking at the East River Road Garage (<a target='_blank' href="http://www1.umn.edu/pts/maps/Library/stadium/Overview/ERRG.pdf">directions</a>). You can find information about parking costs <a target='_blank' href="http://www1.umn.edu/pts/park/facilities/errramp.html">here</a>. From the garage, use the elevators to go to level A, and head into Coffman Memorial Union to find the Great Hall.
